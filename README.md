## I added 6 main sections to the portfolio page.  Header, Hero, About Me, My Projects, Contact Me, & the Footer section

##### In the header I have my name at the top left, and I added navigation to list the different sections be able to jump to by clicking on the associated word.  

##### In the hero section, I added a picture of myself and a temporary subtitle.  Since I didn't have a call to action on this part of the page. I thought it was important to add a picture to warm the view up to who I am.  I added a background banner of the beginning of the loas ocean, as this journey has just begun.  I also decided in the media queries that it wasn't necessary for my subtitle box to be part of the screen when you scaled down the screen size, so I added display: none to .hero-subtitle.  This was a new command for me!

##### The About Me section just has a basic intro that will be updated over time but will be a good placeholder for now.

##### I added a line to the right of every section to help give the site some flow.  I would still like to line them up better to all be uniform.

##### My Projects sections is the beef of the site.  I only have 3 projects so far, but I am exicted to keep adding to this for my portfolio.  I stacked the Run Buddy at the top since this is the most complex project yet. I included article classes inside of the section for my flex box layout. You can also click the links to go to the pages they are directed too and the opacity allows the visitor to hover over each projects and the color changes light.

##### The Contact Me section all lined up with information such as my phone number, email, Twitter, and my Apple Music link.  This can evlove over time to make it more professional.  

##### The footer mentions future upgrades to the site.  It is nice and simple and hosts my possible future LLC!
